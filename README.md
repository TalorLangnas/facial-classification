# facial-classification
In this project, my classmates [Moshe Ofer](https://github.com/MosheOfer1), [Avichai Mizrachi](https://github.com/Avichai-Mizrachi) and I present our approach to facial recognition using deep learning, along with the experiments conducted to evaluate its performance. We compare the results obtained with our approach to those achieved using logistic regression, and MLP, providing insights into the effectiveness of deep learning for this task.
